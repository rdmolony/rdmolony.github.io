# `rdmolony.github.io`

This website uses ...

- `Jekyll` to transform `Markdown` files into "static" files which the browser can understand or `HTML/CSS/JS`

- `TailwindCSS`[^TAILWIND] to style it

## How to ...

### Launch a `Jekyll` server?

```sh
run-jekyll
```

... to watch changes to `_posts`, `_pages`, `_layouts` etc & automatically rebuild the site

### Launch a `TailwindCSS` server?

```sh
run-tailwind
```

... to watch changes to `tailwind.css` & propagate them to `Jekyll` via ...

> [!NOTE]
> Rather than only styling `HTML` elements via `CSS` or `SCSS` files, `TailwindCSS` encourages targeting specific elements directly in `HTML` via `tailwind` classes.  It reads these `HTML` files to generate `CSS` for you by combining these classes & thus defining things font size, type, color


### Style code blocks?

`Jekyll` (>3.0) has builtin support `Rouge` so the `HTML` generated by `Jekyll` for things like ...

```markdown
    ```python
    def hi():
        print("hi)
    ```
```

... will automatically include classes that `Rouge` can hook into for styling.

`Rouge` needs me to define `CSS` for these classes which I can generate `assets/css/syntax.css` via ...

```sh
bundle exec rougify style github.dark > assets/css/syntax.css
```
