## 2021-23

I maintained & developed `Mainstream Renewable Power`'s proprietary data platform `StationManager`. I rebuilt this system on top of new foundations in an effort to tackle this sytem's complexity.  It wasn't plain sailing, but was ultimately worth the effort.  I reflect on this experience in detail in [Struggling to Sync Sensors & Databases]({% post_url 2023-12-04-struggling-to-sync-sensors-and-databases %})

> `StationManager` monitors `Mainstream`â€™s globally distributed fleet of meteorological sensors, which are used to estimate site-specific wind/solar energy yields


## 2019-21

I built out tooling in `Python` to "reproducibly" estimate regional building energy demands at `Codema` as part of the Dublin Region Energy Masterplan project,  which subsequently fed into the Dublin municipality energy planning processes.  I reflect on this experience in detail in [From Excel to Python]({% post_url 2023-11-09-from-excel-to-python %})


## 2014-19

I studied "Mechanical & Manufacturing Engineering" at `Trinity College Dublin` & for one year at the `Australian National University`, where I was introduced to energy systems which motivated my next stint at `Codema`.

> My 2018-19 design project - [A Brief Spell Re-engineering Corporate Team Building]({% post_url 2021-09-09-a-brief-spell-reengineering-corporate-team-building %}) - was a big driver for me to switch into software as I found the most interesting work to be software-oriented
