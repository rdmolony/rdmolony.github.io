I’m a Dublin-based software engineer with experience in full-stack web development, data engineering & analytics.

I am passionate about using computers to solve problems by leveraging simple software tooling appropriate to the problem’s context. My goal is to continue to build a rich toolkit from which I can pull to craft elegant solutions (joyful, maintainable & fault-tolerant). 

I do not believe in one size fits all, or that new is necessarily better, but rather that every software-solvable problem has a different context, and that this context merits careful attention before diving into a particular solution.
