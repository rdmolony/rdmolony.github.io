This website is built on top of multiple free and open source tools.

The source code itself is freely available [on `GitHub`](https://github.com/rdmolony/rdmolony.github.io).


## [`Jekyll`](https://jekyllrb.com/)

Web browsers understand `HTML` files. Humans, by comparison, have a harder time understanding them, since they're not particularly easy for a human to read! `Jekyll` lets me create a website using a human-readable file type called `Markdown`, and it transforms this `Markdown` into `HTML` for me.

More concisely, these `Markdown` files content is created using two different languages, `Markdown` and `Liquid`, which `Jekyll` uses to carry out different jobs:

- The `Markdown` language allows me use special symbols (like `# Header`) instead of `HTML` (`<h1>Header</h1>`

- The `Liquid` language allows me to perform magic, and do anything else not related to content - like specifying page metadata (like dates), or performing special operations like linking pages to one another.


## [`TailwindCSS`](https://tailwindcss.com/)

`Jekyll` helps me with content, however, it does not help me with the appearance of my content. For this, I rely on the `TailwindCSS` library. 

I love this library because I love how it feels to use.

It allows me to style my interface in an interactive way. Specifically, I can edit the appearance of say buttons, and watch the appearance change in real time without having to refresh a page. 

It provides me with simple utilty classes which I can combine together to create more complex behaviour.

Having said all of that, I'll admit that the end result is hard to read, however, this doesn't particularly bother me because it feels so damn good.
