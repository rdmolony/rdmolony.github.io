# CV

## 2023-25

I started two companies `Thalora Ltd` and `PowerScope Ltd`.

At `Thalora Ltd`, I continued to work with `Mainstream Renewable Power` (MRP) on a part-time consultancy basis. I helped maintain the `StationManager` platform, and continued as assist with any analytics that relied on custom programming tools. Having struggled to tame a messy, legacy code base, I was also interested in freeing up time to dedicate towards learning some of the “big ideas” in software that might help me in a similar situation in the future.

In parallel, I started another company, PowerScope, with Terry McGrenaghan. We originally formed to solve a gap which Terry had spotted in the energy market. Specifically, he found that solar installers did not yet have the capability to figure out the investment case battery storage for large-scale commercial projects. Unfortunately, in April 2025, after a long struggle, we decided not to continue with this business.

I was hired by `Mainstream Renewable Power` (MRP), a global wind and solar developer, to overhaul their proprietary data platform `StationManager`. 

This platform monitors and provides access to MRP's globally distributed fleet of sensors, whose data forms the basis of MRP's greenfield projects. When I joined, the platform was not in a healthy condition. Connections to sensors broke frequently, which prevented our team of analysts from doing their jobs. The system was untested, and highly interconnnected, which made changes stressful, risky and time consuming. In time, I rebuilt and migrated the entire system to new foundations, which eventually led to a simple, robust & reliable system. I also supported the analytics team with any analytics that relied on custom programming tools. We maintained our own `Python` libraries to enable analytics which was not well covered by off-the-shelf software. 


## 2019-21

My first job was at `Codema`, a non-for-profit energy consultancy. 

I was hired to work on a research project, the Dublin Region Energy Masterplan, which subsequently formed the basis of the four Dublin municipalities' master plan energy policy. The goal of the project was to derive insights about the Dublin energy system from various publicly available datasets. Specifically, I was in charge of modelling the impact of policy changes on the built environment, and in so doing I developed my own in-house energy model in `Python`. This model, and it's underlying tools, were developed in the open as free and open source software and remain [publicly available](https://github.com/codema-dev/projects).


## 2014-19

I earned a Mechanical & Manufacturing Undergraduate & Masters Engineering Degree at `Trinity College` in Dublin, which included one year of study abroad at the `Australian National University` in Canberra. 

I was fortunate that my degree remained multidisciplinary for two years. This meant that I was also exposed to computer, electrical & civil engineering, which meant that I upskilled (to a basic degree) in multiple programming languages (`C++`, `Matlab`, `C#`, `Arduino`). This foundational knowledge proved to be very useful to me in subsequent years when I taught myself `Python` to do data analytics.

I was also lucky to have been one of eight people selected to participate in a one year multidisciplinary design program during my Masters year at `Trinity College`. This program was unusual in that my team of four were funded by a corporate sponsor to solve a real-world design problem. This meant that we had a budget to create prototypes and to travel. Although I was on my team as a mechanical engineer, the various design challenges I took on with on this team pushed me towards learning software as a tool for solving design problems.
