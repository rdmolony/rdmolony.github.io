# CV

## 2023-25

I started two companies `Thalora Ltd` and `PowerScope Ltd`.

At `Thalora`, I continued to work with `Mainstream Renewable Power` (MRP) on a consultancy basis.

In parallel, I started another company, `PowerScope`, with Terry McGrenaghan. Our initial interest lay in creating a software tool to model the investment case for battery storage for large-scale commercial projects. In pursuing this, we sought out parties approaching the energy market from different perspectives as we felt that this would give us a richer understanding of the opportunities that were emerging. In April 2025, though we had made good progress, for a variety of reasons, we decided not to continue with `PowerScope`.


## 2021-23

I was hired by `Mainstream Renewable Power` (MRP), a global wind and solar developer, to overhaul their proprietary data platform `StationManager`. 

This platform monitors and provides access to MRP's globally distributed fleet of sensors, whose data forms the basis of MRP's greenfield projects. When I joined, the platform was not in a healthy condition. Connections to sensors broke frequently, which prevented our team of analysts from doing their jobs. The system was untested, and highly interconnnected, which made changes stressful, risky and time consuming. In time, I rebuilt and migrated the system to new foundations to make it simpler, more robust and more reliable.


## 2019-21

My first job was at `Codema`, a non-for-profit energy consultancy. 

I was hired to work on a research project, the Dublin Region Energy Masterplan, which subsequently formed the basis of the four Dublin municipalities' master plan energy policy. The goal of the project was to derive insights about the Dublin energy system from various publicly available datasets. Specifically, I was in charge of modelling the impact of policy changes on the built environment. In order to do so, I taught myself `Python` data science tooling (`Pandas`, `Matplotlib`, `Numpy`) and built my own energy model and supporting toolkit. These tools were developed in the open and remain [publicly available](https://github.com/codema-dev/projects).


## 2014-19

In 2018, I graduated from mechanical engineering in Trinity College Dublin with 1st class honours (gold medal).  In 2019, I completed a 1st class honours masters also in Trinity College, again in mechanical engineering, specialising in energy systems. 

I was fortunate that my degree remained multidisciplinary for two years. This meant that I was also exposed to computer, electrical & civil engineering. This forced me to upskill in multiple programming languages (`C++`, `Matlab`, `C#`, `Arduino`), and provided me with foundational knowledge that proved to be very useful in subsequent years.

I was also lucky to have been one of eight people selected to participate in a one year multidisciplinary design program during my Masters year at `Trinity College`. This program was unusual in that my team of four were funded by a corporate sponsor to solve a real-world design problem. This meant that we had a budget to create prototypes and to travel. I found myself gripped by user-centered design, which motivated me to develop my own software skills as a means for solving design problems.
