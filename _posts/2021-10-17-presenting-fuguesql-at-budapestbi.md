In 2021, in collaboration with Kevin Kho, I presented a brief introduction to `FugueSQL`,  a language that allows heavy SQL users to work on Python-based DataFrames,  at the [2021 `BudapestBI` conference](https://budapestbi.hu/2021/hu/eloadok/kevin-kho/)

At the time I was helping the project to improve its tutorials & documentation, so maintainers Kevin & Han Wang gave me the opportunity to pitch in on an upcoming presentation.  Kevin & Han were a joy to work with during that brief stint.  

At the time I felt that `Fugue` was freeing up a lot of complexity in the `Python` data space by providing a unified interface to computing libraries/frameworks & wanted to spread the word.  Just write `SQL` or `Python` & `Fugue` handles running it on `Spark/Dask/DuckDB` etc.  It was really very liberating.

I felt a little bit of an imposter presenting a `FugueSQL` tutorial having not really used `FugueSQL` myself in any great depth!

I drifted from the project as my focus shifted more towards web development.
